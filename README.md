## Releasing & Publishing your plugin

### 1.a. Automated Release

This repository contains Github Actions workflow that automates the release process by pushing a tag prefixed with `v`:

1. Push a version tag
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. Once the GitHub Action completes, go to your repository's Releases page
3. Find the release
4. Mark it as "Latest release"

### 1.b. Manual Release

If you don't have the GitHub Actions workflow set up:

1. Build the plugin
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

2. Create the plugin archive
   > The name format is `<pluginId>-<version>.zip`

   ```bash
   zip -r bks-sample-plugin-1.0.0.zip dist/
   ```

4. Go to your repository on GitHub
5. Click "Releases" â†’ "Create a new release"
6. Tag the release with the version, for example, `v1.0.0` (prefixed with `v`)
7. For assets, attach the current `manifest.json` and the zip file
8. Fill the title and description
9. Click "Publish release"

### 2. Publishing to Plugin Registry
